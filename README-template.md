## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I particularly learned in CSS how and when to use units such as %, em, rem, and vh, and I would like to keep practicing to improve my use of these measurement units in CSS.

.text1 {
    padding-top: 1em;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 1.7rem;
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding-left: 1.5em;
    padding-right: 1.5em;
}

### Continued development

I would really like to deepen my knowledge in frontend development and, in the future, master the use of the measurement units I have just learned.
